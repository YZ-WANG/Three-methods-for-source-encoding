# Three-methods-for-source-encoding

## Three methods

* Huffman, LZ-78 and Arithmetic coding for source encoding with an integration. 
* Huffman and lz-78 coding are integrated as a tool for source encoding, which has a simple interface and can choose the method to encode.
* arithmetic coding just achieves basic function and can't perform as well as huffman coding.
